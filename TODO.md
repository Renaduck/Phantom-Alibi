# Project Tasks

- The sidebar (our in-game menu) display the "load-game" option twice. I also don't like that the sidebar and the title screen menu are the same menus.
- Save and load functionality not working blah
- Game title on load screen should be "Phantom Alibi"
- Finish adding script in
- Correct images for each scene/line
- Select correct item and culprit at end gameplay point
- Moving locations functions, calling scenes at specific locations
- Rest of the script needs to be added to the game
- Most of gameplay sections not implemented, but structure for how to do it is implemented
- Have multiple characters on screen at once if they're in the scene, on each side of the screen
- Sora sprite should only appear in the initial scene, after which sora sprite should not appear as the player is sora
