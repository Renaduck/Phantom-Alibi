# Investigation

*[scene, investigation]*

## Clue 1: Lock Mechanism Scratches

*[Click: Interior side of the door lock]*

**Sora**
 "These are… scratches? Tiny and shallow—right above the locking bolt."
 Looks like someone forced the lock to turn. From the outside. But how?

## Clue 2: Thin Line Stuck in the Doorframe

*[Click: Bottom corner of the doorframe / under the door]*

**Sora**
 "There's a thread caught down here…" *(pulls gently)*
 "…No, not thread—fishing line? And it's frayed at the end…"
 Looks like it snapped under pressure. But what was it being used for?

## Clue 3: Red Paint Smudge on Door Handle (Inside)

*[Click: Interior door handle]*

**Sora**
 "…There's a red smear on the inside of the handle. It's not blood… it's paint."
 Exactly the same shade as what was smeared on the outside. Whoever painted the door… touched this.

## Clue 4: Something Under the Bed – A Broken Garrote

*[Click: Under the bed, near Ren's body]*

**Sora**
 "What is this…?" *(reaches and pulls out a broken loop of thin wire)*
 "It's stiff—almost like a noose. One side's twisted, and the loop is… shaped like a neck."
 This isn't rope. This is a homemade garrote.

## Clue 5: Faint Bruising on Neck (Post-Mortem Body Inspection)

*[Click: Ren's body, focus on neck]*

**Sora**
 "There's barely visible marks… like thin red lines circling his neck. Too faint for rope…"
 "…but a wire would leave marks just like this. It wouldn't take much to cut off airflow."

## Other Locations

### Dining Room 

**Tomo**
 *(holding a cup of cold tea, unimpressed)*
 "Okay but like, why would anyone use paint? That whole 'bloody door' thing was so extra."

**Ken**
 *(adjusting glasses)*
 "Red paint doesn't dry instantly. Someone did it right before the scream, otherwise it would've been tacky or dry. Which means they were right outside the room."

**Tomo**
 "…Wait, so wouldn't Ren have heard someone painting his door?"

**Ken**
 "Exactly. Assuming he was alive at the time."

### Location: Séance Room (Earlier Séance Scene)

**Ken**
 *(during the séance setup)*
 "You know, if you wanted to create a perfect ghost hoax, all you'd need is some monofilament line and a decent knowledge of physics."

**Hana**
 *(quietly, almost too knowing)*
 "…Fishing line's basically invisible under candlelight."

**Ren**
 *(laughing)*
 "Man, you sound like you've done this before."

**Hana**
 *(shrugs)*
 "Some tricks are just common sense if you're not an idiot."

### Location: Guest Room (Sora's Room)

**Sora**
 *(examining the old art supplies on the desk)*
 "Hey, didn't you use this paint set for that dumb portrait of Tomo last year?"

**Rina**
 *(laughing)*
 "Oh god, yeah. She made me repaint her eyelashes three times. Why?"

**Sora**
 "This red paint—it's the same one on the door. Was this always in here?"

**Rina**
 "No, I brought it out before dinner. I was gonna use it for a prank later but I never got the chance. Wait… someone must've taken it from this room."
