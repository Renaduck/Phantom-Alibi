Rina glanced around at everyone, biting her lip.

**Rina**
 "Haha… This is getting kinda awkward, huh?"

I could tell she was feeling it too. The distance. The unease. This night wasn't going the way she wanted.

Then, her eyes lit up. That dangerous look of hers.

**Rina**
 *(grinning mischievously)*
 "Okay, okay—how about we settle this ghost debate another way?"

She leaned forward, hands on the table.

**Rina**
 *(grinning)*
 "Why don't we see if we can contact her?"

**Tomo**
 "Oh, hell yes! Now we're talking!"

**Ellie**
 *(nervous)*
 "W-Wait, w-we don't actually have to—"

**Ken**
 *(adjusting his glasses, sighing)*
 "Here we go…"

I just let out a deep breath.

Of course she'd suggest this.
