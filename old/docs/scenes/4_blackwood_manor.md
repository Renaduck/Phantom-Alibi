 "Now then… See, this place? It wasn't always mine. It belonged to a family—the Blackwoods. And the last person who lived here? Died in this very house."

The air in the room suddenly felt colder.

"A long time ago, back in the 1930s, Lady Margaret Blackwood inherited this mansion after her husband died. She lived here alone, after her only son mysteriously disappeared.

They say she never left.

Every night, she would lock herself in her bedroom, muttering under her breath. The servants would hear her talking to someone—but she was always alone.

Then, one night…

She vanished.

Her bedroom door? Locked from the inside.
 The windows? Bolted shut.
 No way in. No way out.

When the maids finally broke it down the next morning… she was gone.

The only thing left in the room?

A single note, scrawled in frantic handwriting:

"DON'T FALL ASLEEP. HE WATCHES FROM THE DARK."

Some say she was taken by a spirit—maybe even her lost son. Others believe she found a hidden passage and ran away.

But the creepy part?

Ever since that night, guests who sleep in her room report hearing whispers in the dark.

Some even claim to have seen a shadowy figure standing at the foot of the bed, watching them.

Waiting.

And those who fall asleep in that room?

They say…

They never wake up."
