# Gameplay Tutorial

*[Enter Gameplay Tutorial]*

Guess I should explore a bit... (Click on objects to investigate.)

*[Clicked: Bed]*

"Huh. Looks pretty soft—" Thump.
 "…UUUUGH. That was a trap."

*[Clicked: Desk & Chair]*

"Do guests actually use desks in their rooms, or is it just one of those 'fancy house' things?"

*[Clicked: Corner Chair]*

"Oh hey, it's one of those… uh… you know…" [pause] "Whatever it's called."

*[Clicked: Window]*

Yup. Method of escape confirmed.

*[Clicked: Pillow on Bed]*

"Wait a second, what's this?"

A crumpled piece of paper peeks out from under the pillow.

*[Crumpled Note Appears]*

'Don't fall asleep in this room.'

"…Huh. That's not at all concerning."

I fold the note and tuck it away. Definitely showing this to Rina later.
