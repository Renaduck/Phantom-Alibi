# The Crime Scene

*[??? – A Scream Pierces the Night]*

**???**
 "AAAAAAAAAAAAA—!"

My eyes snapped open.

I sat up in bed, heart slamming against my ribs.
 No time to change—my hoodie was half on, socks mismatched, but I was already out the door and into the hallway.

There, huddled on the ground, was Ellie, pointing at a door with wide, terrified eyes.

Something red was smeared across the wood in thick, dripping lines.

Paint.
 The smell hit me first—sharp and synthetic.

Still wet.
 Whoever did this was here just moments ago.

**Sora**
 "Ellie—did you see who did this?"

**Ellie**
 *(shaking, barely holding it together)*
 "N-No… I-I was just going to the bathroom… and then I—I saw—"

Her voice cracked, her finger trembling as she kept pointing.

I stepped up to the door and jiggled the handle. Locked.

Whose room was this?

I knocked.

**Sora**
 "Hey, can you come out for a sec? Something really weird's going on out here."

Silence.

No footsteps. No voice.
 Nothing.

Which was odd, considering Ellie had screamed bloody murder loud enough to wake the dead.

Footsteps pounded down the hall—
 The others were finally arriving.

**Ken**
 *(deadpan, rubbing his temples)*
 "Seriously? Are we doing a haunted house bit now? We're in high school. Try to act like it."

**Tomo**
 *(storming in with a scowl)*
 "Who the heck is interrupting my beauty sleep—"

She stopped mid-sentence, catching sight of the red door.
 Her face was bare without makeup. Honestly, I barely recognized her.

**Rina**
 *(eyes narrowing as she looked at the door)*
 "Wait… isn't that Ren's room?"

A chill crept down my spine.

**Sora**
 "Yeah. And he's not answering. The door's locked."

**Rina**
 *(already turning on her heel)*
 "There's a master key downstairs. I'll grab it!"

She bolted.

Ellie sat on the floor, hugging her knees and crying quietly while the rest of us stood there in tense silence, whispering in uneasy tones.

Seconds crawled by.
 Then—

**Rina**
 *(returning, a bit breathless)*
 "Got it! Sorry, it took a second—it wasn't in the drawer I thought it was."
 She held up a gleaming key.
 "Alright… let's see what the prankster's hiding."

She slid the key into the lock.
 Turned it.

Click.

And right then—
 A horrible chill ran through me.
 Familiar. Dreadful.
 Like I'd been here before.

And as the door creaked open—

My worst fears stepped out to greet me.
