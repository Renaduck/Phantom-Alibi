# Ouija Board Scene

*[Scene: Ouija Board – All Characters Present]*

*[Visual: the board]*

**Rina**
 *(grinning like she's been waiting her whole life for this)*
 "All right, now that everything's perfectly spooky, let's try to summon our very special guest."

She had gone all in: dimmed lights, wax-dripping candles, and a lace shawl over her shoulders like she was auditioning for Paranormal Housewives.

**Hana**
 *(arms crossed, eyebrow raised)*
 "Let me guess—we chant some gibberish, the lights flicker, and someone pretends to faint?"

**Rina**
 *(holding up a scratched-up coin like it was the holy grail)*
 "Nothing so dramatic. We just all place our fingers on this, focus, and call out to the dearly departed."

**Ken**
 *(adjusting his glasses, voice flat)*
 "You know there's no empirical support for any of this. It's all based on ideomotor response and group suggestion."

**Tomo**
 *(grinning as she elbows him lightly)*
 "Okay, Professor Buzzkill. Let us peasants enjoy our haunted circus."

**Ellie**
 *(already looking like she wants to be anywhere else)*
 "A-Are we sure we should do this? This kind of stuff… it doesn't feel right."

**Ren**
 *(leaning back with a smirk)*
 "What, you think the ghost's gonna reach out and strangle one of us? That'd be awesome."

**Sora**
 *(thinking)*
 If we all make it through this night without punching Ren, it'll be a miracle.

Everyone slowly places their fingers on the coin. It's cold—colder than it should be.

All eyes turn to Rina.

**Rina**
 *(lowering her voice to a theatrical whisper)*
 "We call upon the spirit of Lady Margaret Blackwood. If you are with us... give us a sign."

Silence.

Then—
 The candles flutter as if someone breathed across them.
 A chill drifts through the room, cutting through the air like a knife.

No open windows. No drafts.
 Everyone tenses.

**Ren**
 *(grinning but suddenly unsure)*
 "Okay... that's actually kind of freaky."

**Rina**
 *(completely committed)*
 "Lady Blackwood, tell us what happened to you. We are listening."

The coin trembles—then moves.
 Fast. Almost too fast.
 Letter by letter:

I… W… A… S… K… I… L… L… E… D.

The room is dead silent.
 Even Ren's smirk has faded.

**Ellie**
 *(whispers, voice breaking)*
 "I… I really want to stop. Please. This isn't fun anymore."

**Ren**
 *(trying to salvage the mood)*
 "Aw, c'mon, don't wimp out now! We just hit the creepy jackpot!"

**Ellie**
 *(on the verge of tears)*
 "No! That's enough! We have to stop—please, stop!"

Her hands tremble. Her eyes are full of panic.
 She looks like she's about to run and never look back.

**Hana**
 *(firm, standing up)*
 "All right, that's it. We're done."

She strides over and flips the light switch.

The room is suddenly blinding—shadows gone, illusion shattered.

**Tomo**
 *(stretching with a yawn)*
 "Well, that was fun while it lasted. Guess the ghost had better things to do."

**Ken**
 *(shaking his head)*
 "Or the ghost just doesn't appreciate being misquoted."

**Sora**
 *(calmly, voice cutting through the awkward silence)*
 "Okay. We're all a little spooked and a lot tired. Maybe it's best we call it a night?"

**Rina**
 *(sighing dramatically)*
 "Ughhh… I can't believe I'm getting shut down by my own party. I was finally getting somewhere!"

No one replied.
 Everyone had already started drifting out—quiet, shaken, eyes avoiding the board.

Ren lingered by the doorway, glancing back.
 His voice, for once, was lower. Less cocky.

**Ren**
 "…You guys think someone was just pushing it, right?"

No one answered.

And when they were all gone, I stayed behind for a second.
 The board sat still.
 The candles flickered softly, as if breathing.

And the cold…
 The cold hadn't left.
