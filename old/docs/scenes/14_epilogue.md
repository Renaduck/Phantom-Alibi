# Epilogue

*[Post-Scene – Hallway, Later That Night]*

Everyone had gone to bed, or at least tried.
 Rina sat quietly by the fire. Ken was making calls. Tomo had actually offered Ellie tea—first kind thing she'd done all weekend.

I lingered in the hallway, outside Ren's room.

There was something still stuck in my chest. Like the story wasn't finished.

That's when I saw it—beneath the baseboard.

A scrap of paper.

*[Item Collected: Crumpled Note 2]*

Same handwriting as the first one I found under my pillow.
 Jagged. Uneven. Like it was written in a rush.

"He wasn't the only one.
 The others will pay too."

**Sora**
 *(narration)*
 My blood ran cold.

Who wrote this? Hana?
 Or someone else still hiding in this house?

Whatever it was…
 This wasn't over.

Not even close.
