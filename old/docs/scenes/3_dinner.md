# Dinner Scene

I make my way downstairs, only to be joined by another girl descending beside me.

First impression? Loud.
 Second impression? Even louder.

She's covered in makeup, radiating that particular brand of energy that makes me instantly tired.

**???**
 *(grinning, arms crossed)*
 "Kyahaha! So I guess Rina just lets anyone off the street crash her parties, huh? Where do you go to school—St. Juliet's School for the Poor?"

A real charmer, this one.

From the bottom of the stairs, Rina shoots her a glare.

**Rina**
 *(deadpan, unimpressed)*
 "That's an absolutely tasteless joke to make about my best friend, Tomo."

**Sora**
 *(shrugging, smirking)*
 "No, no, she's got a point. They make us eat gruel every Tuesday. Sometimes they even let us work out in the yard."

**Tomo**
 *(horrified gasp)*
 "Wait— is this a school or a prison?!"

*[INTERIOR: Dining Room]*

**Rina**
 "Ta-da! Feast your eyes, peasants. Years of forced culinary training finally paying off."

The food looked amazing. Say what you will about Rina, but when her parents made her take cooking classes, they created a monster—a monster that could absolutely out-chef any of us.

**Ren**
 "You know, I never thought a snooty chick like you could cook."

Bits of food launch from his mouth with every word.

**Ken**
 *(cringing)*
 "…Has anyone ever told you that you eat like an actual wild beast?"

**Ren**
 *(grinning)*
 "Yeah, my mom says that sometimes. Why?"

**Ken**
 *(sighs)*
 "Forget I asked."

**Rina**
 "Not to interrupt your charming little bromance, but I had an idea to spice up the night a little."

I knew that tone. The "I'm about to make things weird" tone.

**Rina**
 *(grinning)*
 "How about a little ghost story?"

I barely resisted rolling my eyes. Not this again. She'd told me this story a hundred times as kids, and even now, she was still obsessed. Some things never change.

Before anyone could protest, she continued.

**Rina**
 *(smirking)*
 "Oh, and just so you all know—the buses won't be running until noon tomorrow."

Well. That's ominous.

**Ellie**
 *(fidgeting, nervous)*
 "Uh… I-I don't think this is a good idea—"

**Tomo**
 *(grinning)*
 "Shhh~! Let the lady tell her tale. If we're gonna be trapped here, might as well get into the mood."

Rina leaned in, lowering her voice, letting the firelight dance dramatically across her face.
