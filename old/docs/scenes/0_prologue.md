# The Cabin Party

## Prologue

*[Black screen]*

I-It wasn't supposed to be like this.
 It was just a game.

*[Flash of crime scene]*

He can't really be dead… right?

*[???]*

Huff... huff...
 Looks like I finally made it. Just a train, two buses, and a scenic hike through nowhere.

*[Mansion – A girl's sprite appears]*

**???**
 "I don't know why Rina picked her summer cabin of all places for a birthday party. Kind of a pain making everyone commute all the way out here. But I guess I'll never understand rich people..."

*[Door creaks open – Inside of mansion revealed]*

**???**
 "Sora! Right on brand—last one here, as always."

There she is—Rina. Once my quiet childhood friend, now a social butterfly who throws parties in the middle of the woods.

**Sora**
 "Oh yeah, thanks for the warm and totally not sarcastic welcome."

Not much to say about me. Just your average high school girl who somehow got roped into this.

**Rina**
 "Come on, let me introduce you to everyone!"

She gestures toward a grumpy-looking girl who clearly didn't want to be here.

**Rina**
 "This is Hana!"

**Hana**
 *(arms crossed, unimpressed)*
 "Nice to meet you. Rina talks about you all the time. I've even heard some of your bathtime stories."

**Sora**
 "Wow. Fantastic. Just what I wanted to hear."

**Rina**
 *(grinning)*
 "Oh, come on, you used to be so cute back then! Back when you weren't such a buzzkill."

If I knew this party was going to be a roast, I would've stayed home.

I shift my gaze to the corner of the room, where a studious-looking guy stands stiffly. Didn't peg Rina for the type to date bookworms, but we haven't talked in a year. Ever since she transferred to that fancy private school, we kind of… fell apart.

**Rina**
 "Oh! That's Ken, our class president. If you're ever in trouble, he's the guy to go to."

**Sora**
 "Noted."

Standing next to him is… trouble. The kind of guy your parents warn you about.

**???**
 *(smirks)*
 "Hey there, sweetheart. You can just ask me out instead of staring."

**Ken**
 *(sighs, already exhausted)*
 "Ren, for the love of everything decent, please stop harassing people."

**Ren**
 *(grinning, clearly not sorry)*
 "What? It's called charisma."

Yeah. This is gonna be a long night.

**Rina**
 *(hands on hips, teasing smirk)*
 "Oh, you boys. Behave, or I'll feed you to the wolves. They'd be happy to eat a meathead like Ren."

**Ren**
 *(grinning)*
 "Bold of you to assume they'd pick me first."

**Ken**
 *(sighs)*
 "They would. No contest."

**Rina**
 *(ignoring them, turning to Sora)*
 "Come on, let me show you to your room before you get sucked into their nonsense."

Before I can protest, she grabs my arm and drags me up the grand staircase. For a place she calls a "log cabin," this place sure screams 'inherited wealth' more than 'rustic getaway.'

At the very end of the hall, she stops and gestures.

**Rina**
 "This one's yours! Get comfy—dinner's in 30 minutes, so take your time."

The door clicks shut behind her, and I take a look around. Pretty plain. Not what I expected from a mansion, but at least it's quiet.
