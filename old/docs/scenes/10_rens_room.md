# Ren's Room

*[Inside Ren's Room]*

He was there.

Ren.

Slumped on the floor, his back awkwardly propped against the edge of the bed.
 One hand limp in his lap.

Eyes wide open.
 Staring at nothing.

I rushed to him—
 Grabbed his shoulders—

**Sora**
 "Ren? Hey—wake up!"

I shook him once.
 Twice.

His skin was cold.
 Not just chilly.
 Cold.

And then I knew.
 Without needing to check his pulse.
 Without needing to say it out loud.

Ren was dead.

And someone in this house did it.

There's no way the police will make it to us before the killer escapes with the storm the way it is.

I have to investigate
