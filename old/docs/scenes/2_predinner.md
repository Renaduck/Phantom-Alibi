# Pre-Dinner Scene

*[Notes on the Paper]*
— Slightly damp. Looks like it's been here a while. No name. No answers.

Guess it's time for dinner. Might as well head down.

As I step out, I collide with something—no, someone. A small girl, practically weightless, but the impact still catches me off guard.

At her feet, a torn piece of paper flutters to the ground. My breath catches.

It looks just like the one in my pocket.

**Sora**
 "Oh, uh—are you okay?"

I offer her a hand, but she's up in an instant, snatching the paper away like I just tried to steal state secrets.

Suspicious.

I know this girl. I've seen her in pictures with Rina before.

**Sora**
 *(casual, but probing)*
 "You're Ellie, right? What was that you just dropped?"

I try not to pry, but let's be real—curiosity is practically in my DNA.

**Ellie**
 *(visibly nervous, gripping the paper tight)*
 "Y-Yeah, that's right. But it's— it's nothing! I-It's not a-anything to do with you!"

And just like that, she bolts.

**Sora**
 *(sighs)*
 "Yeah, okay. That wasn't weird at all."

Can I just have one normal day? Is that too much to ask?
