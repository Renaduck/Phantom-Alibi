# Final Confrontation

*[Final Confrontation – Living Room, Night]*

The storm outside hadn't let up. Rain still lashed the windows, and the thunder was getting comfortable.

We sat in a semi-circle around the fireplace. No one said much. We were tired. Shell-shocked.
 But I couldn't let this night end with a ghost story.

Too much didn't add up.
 And the truth? It was in the room with us.

**Rina**
 *(wringing her hands)*
 "So… if it wasn't a ghost, or a prank gone wrong…"

I stood up.

**Sora**
 *(narration)*
 I'd walked through Ren's room, retraced someone else's steps.
 There were no spirits—only secrets. And one of them was about to snap.

**Sora**
 "It wasn't an accident. And it wasn't supernatural."
 "Ren was murdered. By someone in this house."

**Tomo**
 *(raising a brow)*
 "Oh come on—murder? Really?"

**Ken**
 *(coldly)*
 "She's right. Door was locked. Windows sealed. He didn't do this to himself."

**Ellie**
 *(shaking slightly)*
 "B-But it was painted… like the story. The ghost…"

**Sora**
 *(narration)*
 That was the point. Someone wanted us to believe it.

**Sora**
 "The red paint was fresh. Still wet when Ellie found it. Which means Ren was already dead when it was put there."
 "But there's more—look closely at the door."

*[Select correct clue]*

I held up the frayed thread of fishing line I found under the frame.

**Sora**
 "This was jammed under the door. Fishing line—thin enough to go unnoticed. Strong enough to pull the lock shut from the outside."

 It was clever. I'll give them that. But clever plans fall apart under the weight of detail.

**Sora**
 "Whoever killed Ren locked the door after leaving. Painted the scene. Pulled the handle shut using this line, then snapped it off and walked away."

**Ken**
 "Which means… it had to be someone who knew how to stage it."

**Tomo**
 "Okay, but why? Ren was annoying, sure, but not—murder-worthy!"

**Sora**
 *(narration)*
 And this is where it got personal.
 Because I'd seen it in her eyes. Not panic. Not fear.
 Resolution.

I turned to her.

*[SELECT THE CULPRIT]*

*-if selected the wrong person, dialogue is*

**Sora**
 "I don't think that's right, lets try this again-"

**Sora**
 "Hana."

Everyone looked at her. She didn't flinch.

**Sora**
 "You knew how fishing line works. You were calm. Too calm. And when I found the murder weapon under the bed—wire fashioned into a garrote—I knew it wasn't some spur-of-the-moment act."
 "You planned this."

**Hana**
 *(quietly)*
 "…So what if I did?"

**Sora**
 *(narration)*
 The words landed like a slap.
 Even now, she wasn't scared.

**Hana**
 "He wasn't just some punk. He ruined my brother's life. Treated it like a joke. I waited for someone to do something.
 No one ever did."

**Rina**
 *(shocked)*
 "Hana, you could've told us—"

**Hana**
 "And you would've what? Believed me? Told me to let it go?
 I did what I had to."

**Sora**
 *(narration)*
 I could see it on her face—
 No guilt. Just… relief.
 Like she'd finally exhaled after holding her breath for years.

**Sora**
 "The police are on their way."
 "You'll have to explain the rest to them."

**Hana**
 "Let them come."

**Sora**
 *(narration)*
 And that was it. The end of the séance.
 Only this ghost had a name. And a motive.
