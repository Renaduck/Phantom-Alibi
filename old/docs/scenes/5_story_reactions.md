# Story Reactions

Silence.

A tightness sat in my chest. I don't remember that part of the story. But after the note I found in my room… it felt way too close to home.

Then, a snort. A small giggle.

**Tomo**
 "Pffft! You expect us to believe a load of baloney like that? What are we, a bunch of scared schoolkids?"

**Haru**
 *(smirking)*
 "I thought it was a fun story. Though I could have done without input from the rodeo clown over here."

**Tomo**
 "Oh-ho! You've been giving me the stink eye all night, Haru. What, you wanna fight or something?"

**Rina**
 *(exasperated)*

Before she could even finish, a thunderclap shook the mansion.

A loud crack of lightning lit up the room for a brief second.

Everyone's heads whipped toward the window.

Outside, rain had started pouring, streaking down the glass in heavy sheets.

If I didn't know any better… I'd think I just stepped into a horror novel.

**Haru**
 "…Sorry, Tomo. I know you were just trying to break the tension."

**Tomo**
 *(grinning)*
 "S'alright. Not my fault I was born an entertainer."

But something had shifted.

The mood felt off.

Even as the boys went back to trading jabs, even as we finished our meals, no one really knew what to say.

It became painfully clear that the only thing holding this group together was Rina.
